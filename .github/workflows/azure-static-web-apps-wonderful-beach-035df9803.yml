          # However, the SWA action is smart; often leaving this blank or as "wwwroot" works if it detects the Blazor project correctly.
          # If deployment fails, you might need to explicitly build first and set this to the specific build output subfolder (e.g., "bin/Release/netstandard2.1/publish/wwwroot").
          # For simplicity with the SWA build/deploy action, "wwwroot" is often sufficient if your appsettings.json is IN the project's wwwroot.
